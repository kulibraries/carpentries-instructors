    - Appointment for the tech check is forthcoming; needed to be scheduled with the Engineering TSC
    - Cort updated the Etherpad with current dining information. Thanks!
  - Install-A-Thon?
    - Since Price is no longer our location, we can't co-locate the tech check with the Install-A-Thon. Conversation ensued RE whether it was worth having.
