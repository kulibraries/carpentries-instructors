### Discussions

**January meeting?**

The January meeting was canceled. February was the first meeting of 2020.

**Announcements**

- [CarpentryCon 2020](https://2020.carpentrycon.org/) has been announced for June 29-July 1, 2020, at the University of Wisconsin Madison. This will be the second global Carpentries community meet-up. 2018 took place in Dublin and 2021 is scheduled for South Africa (no announced city yet). Registration is open; there are options for financial aid.
- The Carpentries hosts community calls with other instructors on a regular basis. These are a nice way to prep before a workshop and debrief after a workshop is over. Find the schedule on the [Community Calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events) or sign up for a call on the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).

**Checkout Tasks and Instructor Training**

One attendee reported that checkout tasks should be completed by the end of February. A couple of people are planning to attend instructor training in April.

**January 2020 Workshop Debrief**

Tami and Elizabeth taught Bash, Git, and R for a Software Carpentry workshop on January 15-16, 2020 ([https://kulibraries.github.io/2020-01-15-ku/](https://kulibraries.github.io/2020-01-15-ku/)). After reviewing the workshop pre- and post-survey results, we discussed the plus/delta feedback:
- Workshop space:
  - \+ Tables with individual screens were really appreciated by instructors, helpers, learners
  - \+ Fewer learners and more space helped the workshop feel calmer than [2019-08-20-ku](https://kulibraries.github.io/2019-08-20-ku/)
  - &Delta; Presenter podium didn't allow for split screen; needed to use two computers or paper notes to see notes privately and share screen with the room.
  - &Delta; Lack of lapel mic left instructor stuck at the podium mic or learners straining to hear when the instructor moved around
- Teaching and helping:
  - \+ Tami: didn't let confusing spots in the lessons tangle up her explanations
  - \+ Tami: happy with how far into the lessons she got; of course would have liked to have covered more
  - \+ Elizabeth: felt that her second day went more smoothly, especially after she reframed day 2
  - \+ Casey: felt that instructors seemed more comfortable and sessions went more smoothly than past workshops; instructors seemed well-prepared
  - \+ R lesson did not get bogged down in path problems; possibly because sample data was moved out of ku-swc-files onto the Desktop?
  - &Delta; Elizabeth: felt she could have covered more than she planned; a function of the number of learners in the room
  - &Delta; Remember to eat and wear comfortable shoes
  - &Delta; Get over the assumption that learners understand directory structure; teach this explicitly and refer to the [directory structure handout](https://github.com/kulibraries/swc-workshop-helps/blob/master/directory-map.pdf)
  - &Delta; ku-swc-files directory (stems from the `git clone` exercise to pull down all the sample data) may add complexity to the shell lesson. R lesson didn't seem to have as many path problems. Maybe pull shell lesson materials out onto the Desktop, too?
  - &Delta; Casey: in the shell lesson, learners get lost; explicitly teach the concept of the Home directory
  - &Delta; Shell lesson: Do a brief active learning activity at the beginning for learners to draw their directory structure; would make it easier to navigate the handout later on
  - &Delta; R lesson: Opportunity to reinforce the Git lesson if providing notes on R via GitHub; assuming notes don't change much between prep and delivery, do `git clone` together at the end of the second day or at least put the command and path into the Etherpad

**Ideas for next workshop**

We have not offered a Python-flavored workshop in over a year; it's probably time. Matt indicated that he is game. In order to not have to wait until a break in classes, we kicked around the following ideas:
- Hold one lesson per Friday for a month, as Oklahoma State has done, e.g.: [2019-11-01-okstate](https://osu-carpentry.github.io/2019-11-01-okstate/)
- No scheduled classes on Fridays, so this may be an easier day during the semester to offer workshops that don't conflict with classes
- Concerns / awareness about scaffolding from one lesson to the next; intentionally bringing people back into the content as the month progresses
- Suggestion to try recording the session so learners who had to miss something could catch up on their own (would need a room set up to record - see thoughts on recordings below)
- Because of spring break in March, April seems like a good time to try this out

**Action items**

- Jamene will get in touch with Oklahoma State to find out how they run registration for a month-long workshop
- Jamene will look for rooms that are available in April; bonus if lecture capture or recording are available
  - Considerations on recording include captioning or transcript to be ADA compliant
  - Recording of a live classroom event may be a bit chaotic for watchers later on
  - Possibility of conducting controlled recordings for all Software Carpentry lessons? Considerations include:
    - Ability to caption one recording per lesson
    - Cover the whole lesson without live learners "interrupting" the teaching
    - Ability to distribute video with handouts and exercises as a package
    - This sounds like a project; would involve a lot of time for our instructors to prepare for and schedule the recordings
    - At KU, the [Media Production Studio](https://mps.ku.edu/) is the most likely partner
