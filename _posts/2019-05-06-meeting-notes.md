### Carpentries Instructors’ meeting
- Monday, May 6, 2019
- 9:30-11:00 AM
- Watson 400B

### Present:
Albin, Koseva, Brooks-Kieffer

### Highlights:
- KU Libraries is partnering with KU IT and the Office of Research to jointly sponsor a Carpentries Foundation membership. Yay! This isn’t officially announced yet and is still in the works, but I wanted you to know that, as of what I know right now, it’s going to happen. This means we’ll have more members of this group at some point in the relatively near future.
- Tami is scheduled to take Carpentries instructor training in early June under the GPN Carpentries membership. A lot of our conversation focused on what to expect during instructor training and fulfilling the checkout requirements afterward.
- Boryana gave a brief summary of her recent venture to the University of Arkansas for a co-instructor role in their first self-organized workshop. This led to a lot of conversation about the tools and structure for workshop websites, as well as adventures in teaching the 3 Software Carpentry topics.
- Those present decided that keeping minutes was appropriate, especially since the group is likely to get larger. While we think Sharepoint might be an option even for those who don’t have a KU Online ID, we settled on a GitHub static site as a better choice because a) it’s not dependent on a KU affiliation and b) it’s good practice for Carpentries instructors to push/pull/fork/branch/pull request. I’ve confirmed that we can host the repository under KU Libraries’ GitHub account (https://github.com/kulibraries), which is also where we host the repositories for the workshop websites and Git/GitHub activities. Look for more on this soon.
- Next time, we would like to talk about ways of getting to the payoff point in a lesson – that being the point at which all the basic information learners have gotten starts to make sense in the context of their own work.
- Jamene will add a Zoom option to the monthly appointment because travel to Watson isn’t always the easiest thing. Please let Jamene know if you still need the calendar appointments.
